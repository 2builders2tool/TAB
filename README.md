## Introduction  
Here it is. After countless requests to go opensource, I did it to make those people quiet. It worked.  
It's already been almost a year and I still can't see any positives of it. This way I just provided trash talkers on paper discord more ways to *do their job* on this plugin.  
  
  
## Compiling
If for any reason you want to compile the source yourself instead of using already compiled jars, you can do so in your IDE. Compiling using gradle is not supported currently. If you are ACTUALLY looking for a way to compile it, you'll find it. Don't pretend like gradle is the official and only way to compile java code.  
  
  
## Contributing
You are allowed to make pull requests if you believe you have useful code changes that will improve the plugin for it's users (not just you). Make sure you test the changes first and don't break anything, such as by injecting bukkit api calls into universal code that will *crash* on bungeecord.  
  
  
## Premium code
The source contains content of premium version as well. However, this must be activated by setting [this line to return true](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/blob/master/src/main/java/me/neznamy/tab/premium/Premium.java#L22). Keep in mind you will get no support for premium features if you did not buy it. If you don't want to support me then I don't see a reason to provide support to you either.
